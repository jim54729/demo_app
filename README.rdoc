== README

One of my first apps with Ruby on Rails

Learned to use TDD,  -Test Driven Delopment,  where we wrote the test code before the code so that we knew if eveything was working correctly.

Learn to push an App to Heroku.app and used GIT to work with it, and share it.

This was from a course offered at Madison College.
